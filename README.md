# k-Tree

This repository contains the implementation of various $k$-Tree methods and their applications to real-world and synthetic datasets. 


## Setup

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/SimonTianPolyU/k-Tree.git
   cd k-Tree

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

    - Scikit-learn: 1.6.0
    - NumPy: 2.2.0
    - Pandas: 2.2.3
    
## Usage
1. To run the experiments for real-world datasets, use the following command:
   ```sh
   python Experiments_Real_Datasets.py

2. To run the experiments for synthetic datasets, use the following command:
   ```sh
   python Experiments_Synthetic.py
